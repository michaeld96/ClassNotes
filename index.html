                My name is Michael and welcome to my notes page! Here is where I will post notes for courses 
                I've completed. Some will be online courses and others will be ones that I've taken at University of Michigan.<br>
                <br>
                 A little bit about me; I am an undergrad majoring in computer science and minoring in mathematics!
                  I want to work with graphic engines! Whether these engines be with videogames or simulations,
                   I just want to design these engines and implement them.

                This class was a continuation of Web Design for everyone, and this was the third course.
                Interactivity with JavaScript taught you the basics of what JavaScript could do for your webpage.
                The notes are written in LaTeX and are available if you click on the class name to the left.

                EECS 203, or known as Discrete Mathematics at Umich is a class that studies: discrete structures,
                propositional logic, quantifiers, intro to proofs, intro to graph theory, probability, counting,
                functions, intro to set theory, and intro to cryptography. Notes I've included relate with universal 
                quantifiers and how to prove them.
